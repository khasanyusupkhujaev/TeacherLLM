#     Problem: Determine the equation of the plane passing through the points A(1, 2, 3), B(4, 5, 6), and C(7, 8, 9). 
# Additionally, find the distance from the plane to the point P(10, 11, 12).

# Student Solution:
# Step 1: Find two vectors on the plane:
#   Vector AB = B - A = (4 - 1, 5 - 2, 6 - 3) = (3, 3, 3)
#   Vector AC = C - A = (7 - 1, 8 - 2, 9 - 3) = (6, 6, 6)

# Step 2: Compute the normal vector to the plane:
#   Normal vector = AB Ã— AC = 
#   |  i   j   k  |
#   |  3   3   3  |
#   |  6   6   6  |
#   = i(3*6 - 3*6) - j(3*6 - 3*6) + k(3*6 - 3*6)
#   = (0, 0, 0).

# Step 3: Write the equation of the plane:
#   Using point A(1, 2, 3) and the normal vector (0, 0, 0),
#   The equation of the plane is 0x + 0y + 0z = 0.

# Step 4: Find the distance from the point P(10, 11, 12) to the plane:
#   Distance = |Ax + By + Cz + D| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2 + C^2)
#   Substituting A = 0, B = 0, C = 0, D = 0, and P = (10, 11, 12):
#   Distance = |0(10) + 0(11) + 0(12) + 0| / sqrt(0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2)
#   Distance = undefined.
# Provide your feedback and conclude with a final grade.
